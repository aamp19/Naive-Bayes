# Naive-Bayes
Naive Bayes classifiers uses probabilities classifiers and is based on the application of Bayes' Theorem. 
Using Bayes' Theroem is can be determined how to find the probability of a specific event occurring based on another given event.
Naive Nayes algorithm is mainly used in analysis which contains string values in the dataset, rather than what machine learning appliers are familar with which are interger values in the dataset
Naives Bayes algorithms are fast and easy to implement, that said the biggest disadvantage of this is that the features are required to be independent of the data.
For this problem I will be using the Gaussian Naibe Bayes classifier where the features are a continuis value and is not discrete.
For this problem, I split up the each message in the dataset
I determined the amount of times each word is written in the message.
I determined if the word SPAM or the word HAM are written somewhere in each message.
Based on this, I was able to determine whether or not the message was a spam email
